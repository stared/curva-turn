# Curva-turn

## Bugs and features

* (FIXED) Not updating neighbourhoods of old nodes (or at least not plotting them)
    * Plotting is fine (or - does not even need to know all)
    * I seem to add neighbours when flourishing (oh, but I see - not always[2]).
* (FIXED) Problem with concave parts, oversaturating and updating when k == k0.
* (FIXED) Problem with visualizing new edges from non-new nodes.
* Better seed to have always a planar graphs
* Add slider to choose no of neighbours
* Add automated addition (growth)
* Add exploration mode
* Put it Twitter's Bootstrap

### Misc

* "neighbours" -> "adj" ?
